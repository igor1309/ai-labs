# Run implementation notes

How a request that resolves becomes a run (ADR-001, "Core" and "Starting
a run"), built in slices. Each slice runs something whole; what it
leaves out is in `backlog/run-path.md`.

## The first run

A workflow whose steps are bash steps, in sequence, runs end to end:
`agister run` resolves the request, core calls each step on the bash
runtime, through the supervisor, and the result is printed.

**The supervisor** (ADR-012, rule 6) is a wrapper. It starts a program
in a directory with an environment, and the program's group with it;
keeps of stdout and of stderr the first and the last 16 KiB, the size
and the SHA-256 digest of the whole; and gives how the program ended: its
exit code, or the signal that ended it. It ends the program and all its
group started when its context ends, by SIGTERM, then SIGKILL when the
two seconds' grace has passed on the timer it is given (ADR-009, rule
5), and when the program exits, whatever it left running. Output held
open by a process that left the group is read no longer than the
grace: the streams are kept so far, marked incomplete. Where it cannot
observe a program's exit before reaping it, it starts nothing, and says
the program could not start. A
program that cannot start is an error that says so. Its tests run real
programs (ADR-009, rule 3).

**The bash wrapper** runs a turn: a script, a directory and an
environment, as `bash -c <script>`, through the supervisor, and gives
what the supervisor gives, its error that the program could not start
included. Its tests give a spy in place of the supervisor (ADR-009,
rule 3).

**`core/call`** declares the runtime protocol: a turn is given the
prompt, the directory and the environment, and gives the output and how
the program ended; or that its program could not start; or another
error. A call makes one turn on bash (ADR-012, rule 7), over the
environment the composition gives, then its process's environment, then
each input by its name; and ends in the result shape (ADR-001,
invariant 3):

| How the turn ended | Status | Class |
|---|---|---|
| the script exited, any code | completed | |
| the program could not start | failed | `runtime_unavailable` |
| another error of the runtime | failed | `runtime_error` |
| the process's time limit | interrupted | `timeout` |
| the caller cancelled | interrupted | `cancelled` |
| a signal Agister did not send | failed | `killed` |
| an input whose source is not plugged in | failed | `refused` |

A turn whose context core ended, by the time limit or the caller, ends
interrupted with core's class, however its program then exited.

A completed bash call's output is `exit_code`, and `stdout` and
`stderr`, each its `head`, `tail`, `size` and `digest`, as the
supervisor keeps it: the fields a binding or an output reads. Timing is
measured by core, through a clock, and the time limit kept by its
timer; cost is unknown, bash reporting none (ADR-012, rule 5), printed
as `null`, never 0. The call's warnings are its step's plan's (ADR-003,
rule 5), given whatever its status.

**`core/inputs`** resolves a workflow's inputs at its boundary, and a
call's before it starts (ADR-010, rule 3), from their sources over the
params given, a param not given taking its default, to a value and its
identity, the SHA-256 of its text; and a process's environment, each
value a text or a reference to its params and inputs. A source is a
port, by name, that the composition plugs in (ADR-010, rule 2); this
slice plugs in `param`: the param named by its `name`. An input whose
source is not plugged in refuses the call before it starts: failed,
`refused`, no source plugged in by that name. The composition refuses
such a run before any step runs; core keeps its own refusal per call,
since a caller of core other than this composition is not checked up
front.

**`core/workflow`** runs a workflow whose items are steps: in order,
each step's bindings giving its process's params from the workflow's
params and inputs and the outputs of the steps before it (ADR-011, rule
3); a value that is not text is given as its JSON. A step that does not
complete ends the run with its status and class; no later step starts.
The run's output is its output mapping, read from its params, its
inputs and its steps; its status and class are its last call's; its
timing covers the whole run; its cost is unknown where a call's is; its
warnings are every call's.

**The composition** answers `cli`'s run from resolve and core. A request
resolves first; a refusal is printed to stderr, and nothing runs. It
builds core's workflow from the resolved settings and from the documents
of the same snapshot resolve checked: each step's script is its
process's prompt, the text of the prompt document; its time limit is its
process's; its warnings its plan's. It runs in the root of the git
worktree that holds the launch directory (ADR-004, rule 1); outside one,
the request is refused. What this slice does not run is refused before
anything runs, naming it: a step on a runtime with no turn yet; an item
that is not a step; an input from a source other than `param`, or with a
brief form; a workspace's revision, clean, or read-write access; a
staleness limit; a process's instruction or guidance on bash. Each is
named, in the order the request's documents give them. A recovery on
bash is resolve's refusal (ADR-012, rule 3). The program's environment
is Agister's own, then the process's, then the inputs. SIGINT or SIGTERM
to Agister cancels the run: the call's program and its group are ended,
and the result says `cancelled`.

**The command line.** `agister run <workflow>` runs a workflow;
`agister run --process <name> --agent <name>` runs a step alone
(ADR-013). `--param <name>=<value>` gives a param, repeated for many;
`--dir` sets the launch directory. It prints the result as JSON on
stdout: status, class, output, timing, cost and warnings. It exits 0
when the run completed, 1 when it did not or was refused, and 2 on a bad
command, with its usage on stderr.

Decisions, each with its reason:

- No record, no hold, no events in this slice: each is a part of its
  own (runstore, admit, watch), and a run of bash steps is whole without
  them. They are next, in `backlog/run-path.md`.
- The bounds, 16 KiB each end and two seconds' grace, are the
  supervisor's, not settings': nothing yet asks to change them.
- What the slice cannot honour is refused, never run unchecked: a run
  that drops a declared check would mislead. Read-write access is
  refused for that: it asks a hold this slice has not.
- The composition reads what core needs and resolve does not give, a
  time limit, a param's default, a source's name, from the documents
  of the snapshot resolve checked: resolve holds only what it reads,
  and the documents have already composed the layers (ADR-002), so a
  value read there is the one resolve checked.
