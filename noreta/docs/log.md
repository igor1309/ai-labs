- Implement the first QA feature, "See active sessions": `src/sessions.ts` maps
  observed sessions to the active/waiting view a session list is drawn from, and
  `tests/active-sessions.test.ts` carries one test per Gherkin scenario, named
  after it. Runtime discovery is a port (`SessionSource`) owned by its client —
  the real Claude Code and Codex adapters are not part of this slice.
- Promote noreta from `research/noreta/` to a top-level project: collect the existing docs under `docs/`, add this README and log, and register the project across the LOC dashboard, the README Components table, and the products page.
- Establish the product definition: vision, name brief, user stories and QA scenarios for the read-only Mac MVP, exploratory implementation notes, and backlog.
